            <h1>About us</h1>
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>FitStyle was born out of a shared passion for fitness and a desire to create gym clothes that not only perform but also look great. Our founders,<strong><em>Quang Phat Mai</em></strong>, were avid athletes who were frustrated by the lack of stylish and functional workout apparel on the market. Inspired by their own experiences, they set out to design a collection that would empower individuals to reach their fitness goals while expressing their personal style. With a focus on quality, comfort, and innovation, FitStyle was founded in 2020</p>
